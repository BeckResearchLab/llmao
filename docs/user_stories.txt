Ashley is a student enrolled in University. She wants one place to access the LD50 value of chlorobenzene. She needs the information to be easily 
accessible and reliable. Ashley needs to find the information very quickly, while having the information being easily accessible and reliable. Ashley
is familiar with machine learning and some of its important components, but is unfamiliar with the field of 
toxicology. She doesnâ€™t know how to ask the questions (i.e., prompt engineering) and feels like when she asks the questions on other LLMs, she feels 
like the model is not understanding her question correctly. 

Joe is a professor of toxicology. Joe wants to check the safety requirements for some experiments he will be running in his lab. He wants the mechanism 
for the adverse outcome pathway of a chemical that he has not used before. He wants to use chemicals that he has not used in his lab before  where the 
chemical information can be more difficult to find and may be inaccurate. Joe is an expert in toxicology but has little knowledge on how to interact 
with an LLM.  

Evan is a chef. Evan wants to double check the dose for a prescription that was perscribed to him by his doctor. He wants little technical information 
about the drug. He wants an interface that is easily accessible and easy to use. He has has no medical background or any knowledge on toxicology.
