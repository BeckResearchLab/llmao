needs the information to be easily accessible and reliable. Ashley needs it to 
be quick. Ashley doesnâ€™t know how to ask the questions (i.e., prompt 
engineering). 

Joe is a professor. Dave wants to check the safety requirements for 
experiments he will be running in his lab. He wants to use chemicals that are
not typical where the chemical information is more difficult to find. Joe is an 
expert in toxicology. 

Evan is very skilled in computational.
